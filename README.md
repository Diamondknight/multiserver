# multiserver
A new "dimensions" mod for minetest. Where each dimension has it's own rules and is it's own sub-server.

Use suggestion: have a seperate spawn building for each "server", and have seperate rules for each "server" (eg. Greifing is allowed in anarchy "server" but not allowed in the roleplay "server".
